        <p>An artist, illustrator, 3D modeler, video editor and everywhere inbetween, thats what I do. I've been Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator certified and have been working with the Adobe Suite since 2015. I currently am a one man band and have learned how to create a lot of various things all by myself. I tend to take to programs pretty quickly and can be pretty fluent in the program in a matter of hours.</p>
